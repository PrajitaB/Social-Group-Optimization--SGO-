# Social Group Optimization (SGO)
Social Group Optimization (SGO), a hybrid optimization algorithm, 95% effective and accurate for large-scale, high-dimensional, and time-sensitive problems by achieving optimal solutions in fewer iterations, outperforms established algorithms such as PSO, ABC, CS, TLBO, and Firefly in just 5 iterations.
